## About
This is my second creative project created for college. You'll have to answer questions in a limited amount of time.

It's an updated version of the old game version. Updated code, graphics, sounds and quiz system. Old version may be released later (not sure).

## How to convert quiz to exe
To create a standalone application, you need to install `Python 3.11+`.
Next, install the `PyInstaller` in `cmd`:

```batch
pip install pyinstaller
```

`PyInstaller` is used to convert the project into an executable `.exe` file.
  
Run the batch file `test_to_exe.bat` to start the conversion.
A `NewTest` folder will be created in the project folder with the converted project into an `.exe` file.
